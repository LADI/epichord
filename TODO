BUGS

if events are dispatched out of order, they are put in order by playing the
rest of the notes after the first-out-of-order at the end of the buffer, causing
an error on the order of 1024/48000 = 21 ms. to fix it, the events must be
dispatched in time order. solution is to enqueue and sort before dispatch.
the above workaround was done because if you try to dispatch them out of order
jack crashes. this occurs when events occur near each other but not exactly
at the same time, or at high bpm.

the pattern drag sound bug is that when a pattern is moved, note offs do not
occur. to fix it, when dragging a pattern you must dispatch note offs in one
way or another.

the hand doesnt point directly at notches 1 and 3 if they are numbered 0 1 2 3
for each beat.

there is a 1 frame error caused by a kludge in the sequencer mechanism.
there are cases where a midi event is to be dispatched on the first 
frame of the buffer, but also on the frame right after the last, i.e. 
index 1024 in a frame buffer of 1024 frames. When a event appears to be
destined for 1024, i dispatch at 1023 rather than waiting until next 
process. a real solution would check the sequencer play mechanism and 
its interation with the backend's real time to see why its considering 
playing these notes.
