This is autotools.

To build the program, do

  ./configure
  make

and then

  make install

as root to install to the default location.


When you run into problems, make sure you have the dependency libraries
installed. FLTK 2 and JACK with midi support (any recent version) is
required. If you want LASH to actually work, you need the latest
release candidate. At the time I write this it is 0.6.0-rc2.

*NOTE that FLTK2's default configuration will not build the shared libs. 
Remember to use --enable-shared when building FLTK2.

After building you may have an error message about missing graphics and
buttons may appear blank. This is caused by not running 'make install'
and attempting to run the program from another location.

You may choose where to install the program by doing

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

This will install the program in /usr (/usr/bin /usr/share and so on)

And if you do not want to install the program, you may set the location
the program searches for graphics and documentation with

  ./configure --datadir=/usr/share

Note that in the above example, the program will search in the directory

/usr/share/epichord/gfx for the graphics and
/usr/share/epichord/doc for the documentation

In order to run the program from its current location without installing, 
for instance /home/bob/src/epichord you can do this

  ./configure --datadir=/home/bob/src
