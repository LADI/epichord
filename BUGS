occasional bug on switching layers - check sequencer/backend details
import midi doesnt handle misfit events - see 'extratracks' in loadsmf
scroll bar size does not indicate scroll range
select coordination between pianoroll and eventedit is buggy (see select_flag)
recording makes undo semi useless
missing graphics
undo is buggy at least when using layers
export midi does not include some important meta events
paste is missing
quantize is missing
hand updates need to be regularized
channel 10 bank 127 bug
undo block creation from inside pattern editor probably leads to problems

backend should send init/stop events on all present channels, not all tracks
backend perhaps shouldnt send tons of messages at time zero

end of frame sequencing bug - unknown cause

some track settings are not saved or restored (one or the other)

remembered scroll position doesnt seems to work after some block ops

track modules gui for prog, bank, etc needs to be changed
bank needs 'none' option

paste does not fully work

undo and redo should reset the select flag
