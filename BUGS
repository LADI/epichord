occasional bug on switching layers - check sequencer/backend details
import midi doesnt handle misfit events - see 'extratracks' in loadsmf
scroll bar size does not indicate scroll range
select coordination between pianoroll and eventedit is buggy (see select_flag)
recording makes undo semi useless
missing graphics
undo is buggy at least when using layers
export midi does not include some important meta events
track settings need readjustment
paste is missing
quantize is missing
hand updates need to be regularized
channel 10 bank 127 bug
undo block creation from inside pattern editor probably leads to problems

backend should send init/stop events on all present channels, not all tracks

end of frame sequencing bug - unknown cause
out of order dispatch bug - sequencer needs to sort dispatched events
