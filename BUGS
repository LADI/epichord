 when changing layers while playing

notes might get stuck. also, if you are violent with it you will get the 
message about notes playing in the past. this is a bad error.

 copying layered blocks

its not acting the way i want. neither is 'always hard copy'

 overlapping notes bug

the algorithm to find the note off will currently fail is it finds the noteoff
of an overlapping note.



 event on end of frame bug

there is a 1 frame error caused by a kludge in the sequencer mechanism.
there are cases where a midi event is to be dispatched on the first
frame of the buffer, but also on the frame right after the last, i.e.
index 1024 in a frame buffer of 1024 frames. When a event appears to be
destined for 1024, i dispatch at 1023 rather than waiting until next
process. a real solution would check the sequencer play mechanism and
its interation with the backend's real time to see why its considering
playing these notes.



 out of order dispatch bug

if events are dispatched out of order, they are put in order by playing the
rest of the notes after the first-out-of-order at the end of the buffer, causing
an error on the order of nframes/samplerate = 21 ms on my system. to fix it, 
the events must be dispatched in time order. solution is to enqueue and sort 
before dispatch. the above workaround was done because if you try to dispatch 
them out of order jack crashes. this occurs when events occur near each other 
but not exactly at the same time, or at high bpm.



  zoom range bug in arranger

zooming has no effect on the possible range of scrolling.
