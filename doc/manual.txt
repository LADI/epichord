overview of the widgets

The first screen that opens is the song view. You can use this to configure
the initial state of the tracks and manipulate the song at a high level.

On the left is the track info panel which has a vertical list of tracks and
their configuration. Each track has the following widgets in the track 
info from left to right:

input selector - clicking here makes the keys appear next that track. 
midi input and keyboard input will be recorded on this track.

track name - type anything you want here to describe the track.

volume control - sets the initial volume of the channel.
pan control - sets the initial pan of the channel.
solo toggle - if enabled only this channel will play
mute toggle - if enabled this channel will not play.

by pressing the + button at the top of the track info panel, you toggle
whether four more track settings are shown, from leftmost to rightmost:

program - select the program for this track
bank - select the bank for this track
channel - select the channel for this track
port - select which port this track sends on


On the right is the pattern arranger. You use this to create delete copy move
and resize patterns in the song.

The timeline at the top of the arranger gives an indication of the current
play position and current loop endpoints. You can click in this to change the
endpoints or set current play position.

The bottom of the screen contains buttons that are always visible whether or
not you are in song edit or pattern edit mode. From left to right:

play button (arrow)   - begin playing the song at current position
pause button (bars)   - appears while playing, pauses play at current position

When you double click on a pattern in the song view, you will open the pattern
editor. Here you can view or edit individual notes and other midi events in
a given pattern.

On the left is the keyboard. This shows what note each horizontal delineation
corresponds to. You can click on the keyboard to send a midi note on this
channel.

The timeline shows the same thing as the song view timeline but zero begins
at the start of the pattern and not the start of the entire song.

The grid or the piano roll region shows notes. You click here to create delete
move resize select or copy notes in much the same way as the arranger.

The event editor at the bottom of the pattern view screen lets you create delete
edit move and copy individual midi messages.
