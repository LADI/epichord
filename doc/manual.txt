overview of the widgets

The first screen that opens is the song view. You can use this to configure
the initial state of the tracks and manipulate the song at a high level.

On the left is the track info panel which has a vertical list of tracks and
their configuration. In each track entry there is a multi-function button, the
track name, the volume adjuster, the pan adjuster, the solo button and the
mute button. Right click the multifunction button to delete the track. Click
under the last track to create a new blank track.

By pressing the + button at the top of the track info panel, you toggle the
track info between two modes. The second mode allows you to set the output
port, the midi channel, and the initial program for each track.

On the right is the pattern arranger. You use this to create delete copy move
and resize patterns in the song.

The timeline at the top of the arranger gives an indication of the current
play position and current loop endpoints. You can click in this to change the
endpoints or set current play position.

The bottom of the screen contains buttons that are always visible whether or
not you are in song edit or pattern edit mode. From left to right:

play button (arrow)   - begin playing the song at current position
pause button (bars)   - appears while playing, pauses play at current position
stop button (square)  - stop playback and reset to time zero
record button (circle)- toggle whether midi input is recorded

loop button - toggle whether the play will loop between current loop endpoints.
keyboard button - toggle whether computer keyboard acts as midi keyboard.
oscillo button - open the configuration window
floppy button - open the save/load menu
question button - open the info/help window


When you double click on a pattern in the song view, you will open the pattern
editor. Here you can view or edit individual notes and other midi events in
a given pattern.

On the left is the keyboard. This shows what note each horizontal delineation
corresponds to. You can click on the keyboard to send a midi note on this
channel.

The timeline shows the same thing as the song view timeline but zero begins
at the start of the pattern and not the start of the entire song.

The grid or the piano roll region shows notes. You click here to create delete
move resize select or copy notes in much the same way as the arranger.

The event editor at the bottom of the pattern view screen lets you create delete
edit move and copy individual midi messages.

the left arrow button in the bottom left will return you to the song editor.
