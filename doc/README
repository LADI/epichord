**Epichord**

This is a program which I have heard described as a classical multi-track
midi sequencer. It allows you to arrange notes and patterns to be played on a
midi bus or record notes from some midi source. It does not make sound
and it does not handle audio in any way. That is the the job of other midi
aware softwares and hardware devices.


**where to get the source**

Epichord is licensed under the GNU GPL, so by using this program you implicitly
accept the ability to get the source code if you do not already have it.

the source is... somewhere...


**how to build**

Assuming you have a basic gnu/linux-type setup (a compiler, X, etc) you need 
some additional libs to build this program.

fltk-2.0      graphical user interface
jack-0.109.2  or any recent version of jack with midi support

After installing those, you can build and do a default install by:

  ./configure
  make

When the build finishes, run the following as root:

  make install


If you have problems during configuration, read the error message.
If you have problems during make, contact the developer or fix the problem 
and contact the developer with the solution.

If you want to install to a different location than the default you must
pass the directory to configure like this

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

You can also set the location where the program will search for graphics
and documentation:

  ./configure --datadir=/usr/share

Currently this means the program will look in /usr/share/epichord/gfx 
for graphics and /usr/share/epichord/doc for documentation.

Run ./configure -h for more configuration options.


**How to get help**

If you cant figure out the controls read the list of controls in controls.txt

If you dont know what you are doing at all, you can read the guide.txt

As a last resort you can try to get help at #lad on freenode

All help is available from inside the program by pressing the ? button.
