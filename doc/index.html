<h1>Epichord</h1>

<h2>a midi sequencer</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Epichord is a midi sequencer. It allows you to arrange midi patterns to be played on midi aware tools, record midi, and store/load arrangements to/from disk. It does not make sound or handle audio in any way. That is the job of other midi programs and hardware to which it can connect. Epichord is a clone of what seems like countless programs available on windows, as well as some attempts to bring this type of tool to linux. In particular, it emphasizes a plain and 'overused' user interface which I believe existing tools either ignored to pursue something better, or just ignored. Here is a partial list of programs which serve as inspiration for Epichord in various ways.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?&q=massiva">Massiva</a>: midi sequencer for windows - the sequencer I used when I was a kid. It's piano roll widget uses space between horizontal rules for white keys, and the horizontal rules themselves for black keys. This compresses the vertical space of the canvas while naturally exhibitting the key signature. It also leaves open the possibility of 'going chromatic' or out-of-key at any time since it does not omit keys. Epichord also uses the pattern block arranger of massiva and many other programs.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.cavestory.org/downloads_5.php">Orgmaker</a>: pixel's custom music maker for windows - while orgmaker is not a midi sequencer and epichord does not make sound alone, epichord tries to be obvious and easy to use at first sight. You will not be required to navigate menus or dialog boxes to start composing.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=fruity+loops">FruityLoops</a>: midi looper / DAW for windows - fruity loops' piano roll allowed editting of notes without switching tools, for the most part. This UI choice is ignored by most midi piano rolls widgets for linux midi sequencers. However Epichord is not a looper.</li>

<li><a href="http://non-sequencer.tuxfamily.org/">Non-Sequencer</a>: midi sequencer for linux - non requires minimal processing power and memory, allows real time editting of events even while recording, and dispatches midi with sample precision via JACK. This program addresses many of the existing flaws of linux sequencers: bloat and instability. Epichord wants to be like Non-Sequencer when it grows up, but with emphasis on the old style piano roll and pattern block interface.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Mouse-driven editting. left click inserts, right click deletes. Move, resize, select, insert, delete, and copy/paste with the mouse and without switching tools.</li>
<li>Keyboard input. Standard tracker layout for qwerty or you can customize it. Space bar is like a sustain pedal.</li>
<li>Piano roll. Black key notes sit on the horizontal rules rather than in between, giving visual cue to their key signature and more easily treating notes as piano music.</li>
<li>Event editor. See midi events and insert/delete/change them. Use a line to envelope controller values, pitch bends, note on/off velocity, etc.</li>
<li>Enhanced recording. Re-record the same block many times by automatically clearing it each time the song loops or pushing a new 'take' that you can review later. Create or extend blocks automatically when you begin recording outside a block.
<li>Block x-ray. See miniature patterns while you arrange them.</li>
<li>Clone blocks. Blocks may share patterns, change one block and you change them all.</li>
<li>Horizontal zoom. By pressing + and -.</li>
<li>Mute blocks. CTRL click on a block to mute/unmute it. May facilitate seq24 style loop performance.</li>
<li>N 4 time signature. You can set the number of beats per measure to break out of 4 4 time. Changing time signature during the song is not planned, but I am accepting implementations or ideas.</li>
<li>Virtual keyboard. It is fairly simplistic, but is functionally equivalent to using the keyboard for input and recording. Hold space bar for sustain pedal.</li>
<li>Record on channel. If you so desire, midi input can be automatically routed to tracks by midi channel rather than the to currently selected one.</li>
<li>Midi pass-through. If you so desire, recorded midi can be directly dumped to the output as soon as it arrives for minimal latency.</li>
<li>Midi scope. A widget that shows raw midi as it arrives with semi helpful annotations. This might have a use.</li>
<li>Midi files. Import and export type 1 standard midi files.</li>
<li>LASH. Save and restore entire sessions of linux audio apps, including their state and JACK connections.</li>
<li>JACK transport(planned).</li>

</ul>


<h3>Download</h3>

<p>Epichord currently changes too fast to release, and lacks many of the planned features. So download the latest git snapshot instead <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/epichord.git">from here</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to help fix bugs or add features, then you will want to clone the repo. Also, you can contribute your changes without my permission by using the "mob" branch. For information on how to clone, merge, commit, and push with git see <a href="http://git.or.cz/course/index.html">this guide</a>. The following command will provide you with a fully functional copy of the latest git repo.</p>

<code>git clone git://repo.or.cz/epichord.git</code>

<h3>Setup Guide</h3>

<p>Epichord uses JACK midi. This means you need a jack daemon running and probably a patch program to run it and connect it to synths.</p>
